People who are reviewing this as the best movie they have ever seen seriously needs to wake up from their dreams. I don't know who planted this idea in their brain that this is directorial tour-de-force by Nolan but one thing is for sure, Ledger saved Nolan's glutes bigtime. His screen writing technique is feeble; creativity doesn't merely consist of just going berserk with visual treat and showing whatever comes in a ten second unchecked, brainstorming session rather creativity requires constraint. And this movie lacked any constraint whatsoever.If it wasn't for the ultracool visual effects and graphics this movie would be nothing but a vacuous thought bubbles of a person. Whereas Nolan's Dark Knight, instilled by Ledger's genius, was entirely character driven, this movie was entirely fueled by graphical eye-candies. A movie resonates over time when you want to watch certain scenes from it over and over and over again in youtube or your blu-ray disc rented from your local Chinese 99c video store. There were no witty dialogs or any memorable scene in the film that will compel me to stay transfixed in the screen and rewind it over and over and over again.Movies like Vanilla Sky had the same concept yet was made more artfully where the director didn't go overboard with visual scenes while having barely substantial plot.People need to seriously have a reality check. But if majority of the viewers are giving positive reviews, and if you are the only one going against the crowd that surely means there is something "wrong" in your system? Tsk, tsk, tsk what naysayers won't realize is that it would be more comforting to delude oneself and jump on the bandwagon saying it was great film, than admit that they got "jipped" $10.00 for some Sony Vegas type of wizardry. Hey it's the summer after all and it's not "cool" to say things which may otherwise offend your friends!
