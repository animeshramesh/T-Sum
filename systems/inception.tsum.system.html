<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> Get a fantastic stunt crew and great special effects team to make this silly stupid storyline look amazing and keep a bunch of immature easily duped people in their seats for two hours thinking they are watching ground breaking cinema but in fact are watching a story that does not have any substance and a plot that is fit for a 14 year old
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> First of all take a very lousy infantile script and dress it up with all kinds of jargon about dreams and subconscious but in fact the story makes no sense at all and has a crude central storyline that is ridiculous - a teenager could make it up
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> No one in the film questions the morality of this; the film doesn't really question the morality of this, or invite the viewer to do so
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> My young teen son was raving about it and forced me to go to it, he was very happy that I was there the 2nd time as I was able to wake him up from the total brainwashing of modern movie making Hollywood style
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>4 its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> Inception" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> Although in a way that is often thin, banal, or hypocritical, usually the sentiments offered to us in movies managed to stay aligned with basic ideas of good and evil
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> 3 a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the "Matrix" movies
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22> The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>
Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24> To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25> "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26> It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27> The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28> That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29> 2 too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30> Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31> For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>I cannot understand why this movie is rated so highly, it is infantile in its storyline and soooo boring
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33> The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34> Cobb undertakes to plant an idea in someone's head so that Cobb's employer can monopolize an industry
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35> Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36> In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Cons: 1 its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38> Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39> The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40> Meanwhile the 14 year old mindset believes in the illusion of the picture and gets 'hooked in' with the violence and the extra wow factor of Hollywood over the top visual blackmail
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41> There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42> I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43> Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird
