<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>At one point Cobb tells us that despite his best efforts, he cannot create a dream wife with the depth and complexity of his real wife
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Could this be Nolan's own subconscious, commenting on his own limitations as a writer and director
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Cobb undertakes to plant an idea in someone's head so that Cobb's employer can monopolize an industry
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Cobb succeeds, and thereby recovers his own life
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Although in a way that is often thin, banal, or hypocritical, usually the sentiments offered to us in movies managed to stay aligned with basic ideas of good and evil
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> First of all take a very lousy infantile script and dress it up with all kinds of jargon about dreams and subconscious but in fact the story makes no sense at all and has a crude central storyline that is ridiculous - a teenager could make it up
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Next take a good smattering of Hollywood A list actors to make it look slick
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Get a fantastic stunt crew and great special effects team to make this silly stupid storyline look amazing and keep a bunch of immature easily duped people in their seats for two hours thinking they are watching ground breaking cinema but in fact are watching a story that does not have any substance and a plot that is fit for a 14 year old
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Pros: 1 its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> 2 its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> 3 its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>4 its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> 5 its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> Cons: 1 its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> 2 too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> I wish the movie was more focused
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20> In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22> Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23> Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24> But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr(Cillian Murphy)
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25> But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26> Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27> To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28> There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29> The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30> Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31> His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32> The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33> Christopher Nolan, ah
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34> what a man he is
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35> His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36> If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37> "Inception" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38> It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39> The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41> In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42> The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>
That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44> DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45> Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46> Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47> The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the "Matrix" movies
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48> There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49> It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50> However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51> For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52> The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53> There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54> It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55> Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56> The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57> I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58> It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60> The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61>The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62> You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63> Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers
<a name="64">[64]</a> <a href="#64" id=64> Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about
<a name="65">[65]</a> <a href="#65" id=65>All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here
<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66> Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island
<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67> Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here
